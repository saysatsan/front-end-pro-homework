Task Description:

You are tasked with creating a simple web application that fetches data from a public API and displays it on a webpage. The API provides information about books, and your task is to fetch a list of books and show them on the webpage.

Requirements:

Choose a public API that provides information about books. You can use Google Books API, Open Library API, or any other API of your choice that allows GET requests.
Set up a basic HTML file with a container element where the book information will be displayed.
Write JavaScript code to fetch data from the API using the Fetch API. Use GET requests to retrieve the list of books.
Use Promises to handle the asynchronous nature of API requests. Handle both successful responses and errors.
Parse the API response and extract relevant information about the books (e.g., title, author, cover image, etc.).
Display the fetched book information on the webpage dynamically. For each book, create a card or a list item displaying its details.
Apply basic CSS styling to make the webpage visually appealing.
Bonus Points:

Implement pagination: If the API supports pagination, add a "Load More" button to fetch and display more books as the user clicks the button.
Add a search feature: Allow users to search for specific books by title or author using an input field and trigger API requests accordingly.
Error handling: Implement a user-friendly error handling mechanism that displays a message when there is an issue with API requests.
